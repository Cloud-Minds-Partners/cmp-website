## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: i18n routing scaffolded in Phase 1 (not Phase 3) — CONCERNS.md flags it as v2 blocker; cheaper to set up at start
- Init: SEO/A11Y/PERF isolated in Phase 4 (quality gate) — cross-cutting, applied once pages complete
- Init: COMP-09 (SEO component) lives in Phase 2 (Components) — it's a component; SEO behavior verified in Phase 4

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 risk: `src/content.config.ts` uses relative glob path `../cmp-knowledge/` — ensure `cmp-knowledge` repo is available as sibling during dev and CI, or Phase 2 content schema work will fail silently
- Phase 3 risk: Real team bios required from `cmp-knowledge/people/` for PAGE-06 (Team page) — verify files exist before Phase 3 planning
- Phase 5 risk: WhatsApp business number not yet allocated — COMP-06/FAB will use env var placeholder through prod cutover (acceptable per PROJECT.md)
